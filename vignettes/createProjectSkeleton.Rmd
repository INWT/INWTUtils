When you start a new project in R, you usually first need a particular file
structure.
This includes certain folders, maybe the structure for an R package including
some basic tests, and several configuration files (e.g., a .gitignore, an
.Rprofile, ...).
You could create this structure from scratch every time, or copy it from an
existing project (followed by deleting all the unnecessary files from the old
project and realizing that you still did not catch the latest version of some
file). An easier way is to do it with the function `createProjectSkeleton()`
from the `INWTUtils` package.


## 1 Usage of `createProjectSkeleton`

`createProjectSkeleton` goes into action in the very beginning of a new project:
You still have nothing or maybe an existing empty folder and you need a complete
file structure as sketched above.
If you wish, you can add a package infrastructure and/or an .Rproject file.
The latter two can also be done separately (see sections 2 and 3).


### Calling `createProjectSkeleton` with default values

Using the function with just the default values will create the following
file structure in your current working directory (which would in this case be 
named *myfolder*):

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(INWTUtils)
createProjectSkeleton("../myfolder")
```

![Fig. 1: File structure created by `createProjectSkeleton` with default values.](skeleton_01default.PNG)

The purposes of the folders are mostly obvious:

- *data*: all data, original or modified, e.g., .Rdata, .csv,
or .xlsx files.
- *reports* will contain R Markdown reports.
- *RScrips* is for your scripts. It already contains an example script to
  demonstrate a useful script structure.

Finally the *myfolder.Rproj* file has been created. It is automatically named 
after the superordinate folder. This .Rproject file is already filled with
useful preferences, e.g. not saving and restoring the R workspace, not saving
the history and inserting spaces for tabs.


### Customizing `createProjectSkeleton`

The resulting file structure can be customized via the following arguments
for `createProjectSkeleton:`

- `dir:` Directory where the file structure should be created (absolute path
  or path relative to the current working directory)
- `pkgName:` If you specify a package name via this argument, a package with
  this name is created in your folder. It already contains the infrastructure
  to use the
  [testthat package](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf)
   and a first test for the code style of your package.
- `pkgFolder:` If you pass a folder name via this argument, your package will
  live in this folder, otherwise directly in the project root.
  The former may lead to a better overview in
  your project root and is appropriate for projects whose main scope is not
  package development, e.g., a forecasting project. This also avoids conflicts
  between the *data* folder containing your data to analyse and the *data*
  folder which is part of the package. However if your project's
  purpose is package development, the package should not be moved to a separate
  folder.
  The package infrastructure is created with `create` resp. `setup` from the
  [devtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/devtools.pdf).
- `rProject:` You may already have an .Rproject file and don't want to create a
  new one.
- `exampleScript:` If you don't want an example script in *RScripts*, set this
  argument to `FALSE`.

For example, the following function call would result in the file structure
shown in figure 2:

```{r, echo, eval = FALSE}
createProjectSkeleton(dir = "playWith",
                      pkgName = "playPkg",
                      pkgFolder = ".", # Default, could be left out
                      rProject = FALSE,
                      exampleScript = FALSE)
```

![Fig. 2: Another file structure created by `createProjectSkeleton`, this time including a package.](skeleton_02otherArgs.PNG)

In addition to the files from figure 1, you can see the package infrastructure
in the project directory:

- The folder *R* for R files containing the package functions
- A folder *tests* (already containing one test)
- An *.Rbuildignore*: This file specifies files to be ignored when building the
  package. It includes *.Rproj* files, *.Rproj.user* folders, and *RScripts*.
- The *DESCRIPTION* file contains your package name and the imports 
  lintr (for the test) and INWTUtils. All other information must be
  added by hand, e.g., your name and email adress.
- The *NAMESPACE* file.

Of course, the *RScripts* folder does not contain the example script,
and there is no *.Rproj* file in this case.
  

## 2 Creating only the package with `createPackage`

`createPackage()` is generally called inside `createProjectSkeleton`.
It can also be called directly, for example if you want to add a package to an
existing project with an existing file structure. Similar to
`createProjectSkeleton`, it receives argument for the project directory, the
package name and the package folder (in case the package should live in a
separate folder).
In addition to `devtools::create` or `devtools::setup` this method already
provides a test for the code style, the appropriate *.Rbuildignore* and imports
in the *DESCRIPTION* file.


## 3 Creating only the R project with `createProject`
`createProject()` writes an *.Rproject* file with useful configurations. You can
specifiy if the project contains a package (logical argument `pkg`), the folder
where the package lives (argument `pkgFolder`), and, of course, the directory
where the .Rproject file is created (argument `dir`).
